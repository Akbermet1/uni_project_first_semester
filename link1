<p id="myInfo"> My name is Akbermet Zhumabaeva, I am eighteen years old and I am from Bishkek- the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic. There are 3 sisters and 1 brother; I am the oldest among sisters, however my brother is the oldest among all children in my family.</p>
<p> My hobbies are: singing, photography, photo editing, watching movies and tv series and traveling. When I was applying to different colleges during my senior year in high school I was very interested in studying in Europe beacuse one of many advantages of studying here was: traveling a lot of other European countries with Schentgen visa! </p>
<p> I started programming four years ago, to be honest, it was hard for me in the beginnig. I had to go through a couple of different cources multiple times to understand some concepts on HTML and CSS, those were the languages that I started with.</p>
